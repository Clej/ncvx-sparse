ncvx-sparse: a scikit-learn compatible library for sparse estimation with nonconvex penalties
============================================================

.. _scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org

**ncvx-sparse** is a Python library for learning high-dimensional linear regresion models (single- and -multi-task) with nonconvex sparsity (e.g. SCAD, MCP, l1-group SCAD).
Solvers are written in Cython and implementation follows the Scikit-learn API.
